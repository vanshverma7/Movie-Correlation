# Movie-Correlation
This project is developed in Jupyter Notebook utilizing the following libraries:-
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn.

In this project, we'll use pandas to read a CSV file containing movie information from 1980 to 2020, featuring films from around the world. Our goal is to analyze correlations between various factors such as name, rating, genre, year, release date, score, votes, director, writer, star, country, budget, gross revenue, production company, and runtime.
